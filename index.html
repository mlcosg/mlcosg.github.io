<h1>UCD Data Analytics Bootcamp - Project 1</h1>    
    <section>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Marcia and this website is the *first* website I have ever 
            made! And it was coded "from scratch," meaning I coded all of the HTML and CSS 
            myself! This website is in fulfilment of the "Web Design Challenge" requirements 
            for the UCD Data Visualization certification course I am currently taken. In other 
            words, this website is my homework assignment!<br></br>
            Additionally, the content for this website is pulled from my first project 
            for the same course, which was a semi-collaborative group effort. My group decided 
            to examine publically available data from the National UFO Reporting Center, which 
            we downloaded from Kaggle.com. We collaboratively cleaned and transformed most of the 
            data together, then chose our own analytic topics to pursue. This website summarizes 
            my analysis of the UFO data!<br></br>
            I was mostly interested in examining trends over time and was curious whether certain 
            sightings of objects might have greater reliability over others, and if so, then it's
            likely we should see some kind of pattern in those sightings over time.<br></br>
            For this analysis I looked at how long objects were sighted for (duration in seconds) 
            by the shape of the object over time. I started by looking at the average duration of 
            sightings by shape (i.e. the means and errors) for observations reported between 2000 
            and 2014. I also looked at the average duration of sightings by shape for observations 
            by day of week. I was curious to see if there were any decernable patterns by day of 
            week. I finish the analysis by looking at some correlations.      
        </p>
