## About the Project
Hello! My name is Marcia and this website is the *first* website I have ever made! And it was coded "from scratch," 
meaning I coded all of the HTML and CSS myself! This website is in fulfilment of the "Web Design Challenge" requirements 
for the UCD Data Visualization certification course I am currently taken. In other words, this website is my homework assignment!

Additionally, the content for this website is pulled from my first project for the same course, which was a semi-collaborative 
group effort. My group decided to examine publically available data from the National UFO Reporting Center, which we downloaded 
from Kaggle.com. We collaboratively cleaned and transformed most of the data together, then chose our own analytic topics to pursue. 
This website summarizes my analysis of the UFO data!

I was mostly interested in examining trends over time and was curious whether certain sightings of objects might have greater 
reliability over others, and if so, then it's likely we should see some kind of pattern in those sightings over time.

For this analysis I looked at how long objects were sighted for (duration in seconds) by the shape of the object over time. 
I started by looking at the average duration of sightings by shape (i.e. the means and errors) for observations reported between 
2000 and 2014. I also looked at the average duration of sightings by shape for observations by day of week. I was curious to see 
if there were any decernable patterns by day of week. I finish the analysis by looking at some correlations.
