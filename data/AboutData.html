<h1>About the Data</h1>    

<!-- <section> -->
    <p>
        The data used in this project is compiled and published by the National UFO Reporting 
        Center (NUFORC) on UFO sightings. The initial dataset was greater than 80k observations 
        and reported on sightings back to the 1960s. After the initial data cleaning and group decisions about 
        the data were made, the dataset the group worked with for our individual analyses 
        was 56k observations. We included only more recent observations (2000-2014), and 
        looked at data on time, location (latitude/longitude), object shape, and duration 
        of sighting.<br></br>
        About the Shapes Category:<br>
        During the initial group cleaning of the data, we coded the shape category using 
        the following meta-schema:<br></br>
        "No Shape Provided" = blank, unknown, other<br>
        "Geometric" = triangle, delta, circle, sphere, round, dome, rectangle, cylinder, cone, pyramid, hexagon<br>
        "Light" = light, fireball, flare, flash<br>
        "Changing" = changed, changing<br>
        "Disk" = disk, oval, cigar<br>
        "Teardrop" - teardrop, egg<br>
        "Formation" = formation of multiple objects<br>
        "Miscellaneous" = diamond, chevron, cross, crescent<br></br>
        Further Cleaning of the Data for the Analysis:<br>
        I further limited the scope of my individual analysis by dropping all observations 
        of durations in sightings greater than 5 hours. (For a discussion on this, see 
        “Comparisons-Outliers” under the Comparisons dropdown menu option above.)<br></br>
        Since my analysis was looking at duration of sightings by object shape over time, 
        I further limited the dataset I looked at by excluding the shape categories “changing” 
        and “no shape provided."<br></br>
        Changing Shape Category - The “changing shape” category showed more variation in 
        general (larger errors) than the other shape categories, and because the notes field 
        provided for that category show more variation in general in how people described what 
        they saw, I decided it would be better to examine the other categories in more detail 
        since they were more consistent in what the observer claimed to be seeing.<br></br> 
        No Shape Provided Category - In line with this logic, I also decided to further narrow 
        the dataset and exclude "no shape provided" as well. However, I decided to keep the 
        "miscellaneous" category since that category was compiled of a subset of shapes (chevron, 
        diamond, cross) where observers were more certain about what they saw.<br></br>  
        Observations in 2014 - I also dropped the observations for the year 2014 since this was 
        an incomplete year in the dataset. The only observations included in my analysis have 
        occurred between 1/1/2000 and 12/31/2013.<br></br> 
        * Group Dataset was 56,739 observations (starting point for this analysis) <br>
        * Number reduced 288 observations after dropping sightings greater than 5 hours long<br>
        * Number reduced 1,482 observations after dropping the "changing" category<br>
        * Number reduced 7,947 observations after dropping the "no shape provided" category<br>
        * Number reduced 1,693 observations after dropping observations made in 2014<br>
        * Total Observations = 45,329
